# Mapping_Earthquakes
Use D3.js, Leaflet.js, & Javascript to engage with GeoJSON files and create interactive data visualizations

## Overview
We are attempting to visually show the differences between earthquake magnitude's across the world for the past seven days.

## Results
We used a URL for Geo JSoN earthquake data from the USGS website in order to retrieve geographical coordiantes as well as the magnitudes off all earthquades over the past 7 days. Once the data is gathered we will add it to an interactive map in order to show the data.

## Summary
Once we used JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes from the GeoJSON data we used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a mapbox map. We did this using an API request which helped create the interactivity for our data.
